# About
3D-weatherForecast is a rather simple page that displays the current weather forecast for a location.
It does so by getting and parsing XML from yr.no (a weather forecast providers in Norway).
The forecast is displayed in a 3D model, simulating the given weather, only a few weather types are supported.
The model is rendered with babylon.js.
